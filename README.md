# ukanren
Playing around with microKanren (in Haskell)

Forked from https://github.com/rntz/ukanren and added
an example for implementing list membership predicate in Prolog (`ExampleMember.hs`).

TODO: try implementing features needed for (the TIPER project)[http://kyagrd.gitub.io/tiper/]
* open ended set unification and map unification (see https://github.com/kyagrd/ExtensibleRecordsWithSetMembLP)
* staged execution of predicates (see https://www.sharelatex.com/project/557756cfdfb75ebd54bf5807)
